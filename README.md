# CS3090Block2Project

This program checks the strength of a given password based on the following criteria:
1. Length
2. Number of special characters
3. Ratio of uppercase to lowercase letters
4. Prescence of identifying information in password (name, phone number, etc.)

DISCLAIMER:
This program does not store any input information after execution, all input data is cleared once
the process is complete. This ensures privacy of personal information entered is preserved.

Ethical Considerations:
Someone could modify this program to store input information outside of the scope of runtime, meaning personal information is kept on file. Doing so would endanger the privacy of users.
