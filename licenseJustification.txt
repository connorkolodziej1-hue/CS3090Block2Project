    For my project, I chose to use the MIT license. This license was chosen as it
allows for permissions on almost all fronts besides liability. This means that modifications, including malicious ones,
are allowed, but that I can't be held responsible for how people use my code. 
    I want my code to be used across many different platforms, both public and private. To do so I need to allow for modification
and as much open source use as possible. Users tend to prefer programs and code with as much open source accessibility as possible, via widely known
public licenses. This is because the privileges of public licenses, like the MIT license, are widely known, as opposed to custom licenses which often require
review to ensure they fulfill a users use-case. Custom licenses can often scare off potential users as they that extra review work to confirm adequacy. As to 
Why I specifically chose the MIT public license, this is because of the liability clause included. 
    The MIT license states "IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
SOFTWARE." Making my project open source creates the potential risk of malicious use. The MIT license protects me from accountability of any said malicious use
by having me not be directly responsible for how anyone besides myself decides to use my software. For example, if someone decides to modify my code to store
any personal information input, the responsibility for doing so falls on said person instead of me.
